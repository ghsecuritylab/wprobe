	* added radiotap header support and automatic detection of the header
	  format used by the driver (prism2 or radiotap).

	* added IBSS split detection: warn when one ESSID (name) is announced
	  with different BSSIDs in beacons from different nodes in IBSS mode.
	  very useful for debugging IBSS problems.

	* new ESSID window: list all known ESSIDs and all stations which
	  announce the ESSID in their beacons including the TSF timestamp for
	  easier IBSS split analysis.

	* new history window: display Signal/Noise/Rate graph

	* new packet statistics window: display the percentage of different
	  packet types and physical rates and other packet statistics.

	* improved filtering framework: allow filtering by packet types,
	  MAC addresses, BSSID.

	* added duration calculation: "AirTime" to estimate the pyhsical usage
	  of the channel.

	* optimized screen updates and buffering: to save CPU time and to avoid
	  loosing packets. added -w and -d options for fine grained control
	  of display update and sleep intervals. -b option to change the buffer
	  size (it's quite large by default now).

	* much more complete and improved 802.11 packet parsing.

	* better node timeout handling, using linked lists. -t command line
	  option to specify node timeout.

	* sort node list by SNR, age, BSSID or channel.

	* -o option to write packet infos into a text file.

	* initial (primitive) B.A.T.M.A.N support.

	* various smaller improvements, fixes, cleanups and beautifications.

	* Added remote capability. Start on one WRT using -q
	  then listen on other WRT with -p [not quite true...]

2006-10-12  Robert Schuster (robertschuster@fsfe.org)

	* various changes to output (requested by Horst :) )
	* fixed some includes (to compile with (k)ubunut)
	* added version and build date to main window

2006-10-12  Sven-Ola aet gmx.de

	* Unfixed some includes. the necesary include
	  addon is required to fix (k)ubunto ip.h whoes
	  but breaks build elsewhere
